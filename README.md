### Hack the dot - Bruchbattle


 - Description : The idea behind BrunchBattle.Live is the battle between breakfast and lunch (hence "brunch") and the kinds of food that they bring to the table. You list of food categories for breakfast and lunch. You will select food category for break and lunch and you will hit the battle button on the page, it'll randomly pick a food item from the breakfast and lunch menus, making a mashup plate for you to eat.
